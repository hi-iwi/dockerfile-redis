# Since version 5 of RDB a CRC64 checksum is placed at the end of the file.  
# This makes the format more resistant to corruption but there is a performance  
# hit to pay (around 10%) when saving and loading RDB files, so you can disable it  
# for maximum performances.  
#  
# RDB files created with checksum disabled have a checksum of zero that will  
# tell the loading code to skip the check.
